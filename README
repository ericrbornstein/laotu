    ~ How do I run this?

      1. Make sure the database path in laotu.py is appropriate for your OS 

      2. install the app from the root of the project directory

         pip install --editable .

      3. tell flask about the right application (if windows, use set instead of export):

         export FLASK_APP=laotu

      4. fire up a shell and run this:

         flask initdb

      5. now you can run minitwit:

         flask run

         the application will greet you on
         http://localhost:5000/
